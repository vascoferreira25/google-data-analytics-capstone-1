The data provided in the Google Data Analysis Course is split by month. At the
moment of writing this report, the data was from 2020-04 to 2021-05.

The data files were in the `CSV` format and were zipped. The original files
were saved in the `./data/external` folder and then extracted to the
`./data/raw` folder.

The data was fetched from [Divvy
tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
